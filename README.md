# LightningSpade

*Overview:* Lightning Spade is a proof of concept implementation of a poker game utilizing the Lightning Network for:

1. fast, cheap, realtime transactions
2. trustless peer interactions
3. painless withdrawls

Right now it is under development as part of my final project at Horizon's School of Technology. It will be finished roughly around the end of December. It utilizes the Lightning Network Daemon implementation from lightning.network and Roasbeef's forked segwit implementation. <br>

This is version 1 of the Lighting Poker App: https://github.com/robertDurst/lightning-app-poker
